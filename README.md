# Symbol Detection Project README

## Description:
This project is a symbol detection system developed for a hackathon. It utilizes Python programming language along with the Keras library for deep learning. The system aims to detect symbols written on paper using image processing techniques and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alikzilla/Symbol_Detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Symbol_Detector
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to create a virtual environment before installing dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Make sure all the dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare your symbol dataset. The dataset should be organized with labeled images (e.g., images of symbols) and corresponding labels.
4. Train the symbol detection model by running the `train.py` script:
   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset
   ```
   Replace `path/to/dataset` with the path to your prepared dataset.
5. Once the model is trained, you can use it to detect symbols in new images. Run the `detect.py` script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py --image path/to/image
   ```
   Replace `path/to/image` with the path to the image you want to perform symbol detection on.

## Project Structure:
